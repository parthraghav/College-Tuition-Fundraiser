          Today is my birthday and I feel a sense of reckless abandon spawn in
          my chest. I came to Reed College knowing more about computers than
          myself and left having better understood both. In spring, when I was
          still on campus, I came out as a proud gay man to my family and
          friends. My sexuality was for a long time a well-kept secret from
          everyone in India just because of how conservative everyone was and
          continues to be. That is until I came to Reed. I met gay men and
          women, non-binary seniors taking Computer Science courses. I saw
          myself free in their freedom of expression, and every second spent
          with them gave me an ounce of courage to come out in the open as well.

        <p>
          When I came out, I felt refreshed, reset of all guilts, and proud to
          accept myself and allow others to do the same. However, the magic of
          the moment soon dissolved into the grim reality. You see I wanted to
          come out as publicly as I could because I couldn’t risk my family
          shutting me down yet again. So, I chose Instagram and my coming-out
          post on Instagram reached nearly around 11,000 impressions. The word
          spread like wildfire. People whom I didn’t know knew me now knew, and
          everyone wanted to talk me out of this or share a piece of their mind.
          I dealt with it all alone, but the worst was to come. My dad had
          borrowed money from local financiers to get me through college, a
          common practice in India. However, all three of them rescinded their
          financial support. Others didn’t want to be connected with my dad. So,
          they cut him off. My dad paid for my education up until I came out,
          and then he just couldn’t. As I saw my dream of education crumble, I
          went to Student Office, Business Office, Financial Aid Office, ISS,
          faculty members, my tears were met with their inability to do
          anything, strict policies to ensure fairness? — and just like that, in
          days, my aspiration to get a college degree was choked out. I withdrew
          from the college, after having given my last bit of energy in
          convincing that I did not deserve to have my education stopped like
          that just because I came out as gay.

          You see in some way, I was preparing for this, slowly and steadily.
          When I was bullied a lot in high school, my dad told me "education and
          passion is your one-way ticket to a better life." I took his words to
          heart and seized every opportunity to learn. When I exhausted
          resources in high school, I discovered the art of computer programming
          and made tons of self-guided projects. My passion for scientific
          communication and hobbyist development won me awards at Intel
          International Science and Engineering Fair, Google Science Fair,
          American Association of Computing Machinery, Indian National Science
          Fair, et cetera. I learned a lot from a computer and an internet
          connection. And yet, all of that amounted to nothing when I picked
          each and everyone’s call as they came in shouting. My achievements and
          hard work and struggle didn’t matter when I went to offices in the
          Elliot, asking for financial aid. It didn’t matter when I wanted to
          register at a local university in my hometown a week ago because I
          didn’t have a transcript. I asked the business office for a transcript
          but because they refused to release my transcript or any form of proof
          of attendance since I have uncleared dues of last semester. This means
          not only I cannot go to Reed anymore, but any university anywhere in
          the world, even my hometown. Things I did for the last 6 years of my
          life to get an education so that I can live as a free gay man didn’t
          matter. None of it mattered, and now I am back to being the afraid
          fifteen-year-old who is clueless about how he can be free.

          President Audrey, I write to you because I am broken. Education is
          important to me to escape the life of struggle my mom and dad have
          seen. I request you to release my transcripts. I promise I will repay
          the remaining $24,802.62 (dues for the last semester) as soon as I get
          a job. I need transcripts to complete a degree elsewhere and I don’t
          have the money right now to pay up my dues.{" "}
