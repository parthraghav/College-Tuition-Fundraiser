          Today is my birthday and I feel a sense of reckless abandon spawn in
          my chest. I came to Reed College knowing more about computers than
          myself and left having better understood both. In spring, when I was
          still on campus, I came out as a proud gay man to my family and
          friends. My sexuality was for a long time a well-kept secret from
          everyone in India just because of how conservative everyone was and
          continues to be. That is until I came to Reed. I met gay men and
          women, non-binary seniors taking Computer Science courses. I saw
          myself free in their freedom of expression, and every second spent
          with them gave me an ounce of courage to come out in the open as well.

            When I came out, I felt refreshed
          </a>
          , reset of all guilts, and proud to accept myself and allow others to
          do the same. However, the magic of the moment soon dissolved into the
          grim reality. You see I wanted to come out as publicly as I could
          because I couldnâ€™t risk my family shutting me down yet again. So, I
          chose Instagram and my coming-out post on Instagram reached nearly
          around 11,000 impressions. The word spread like wildfire. People whom
          I didnâ€™t know knew me now knew, and everyone wanted to talk me out of
          this or share a piece of their mind. I dealt with it all alone, but
          the worst was to come. My dad had borrowed money from local financiers
          to get me through college, a common practice in India. However, all
          three of them rescinded their financial support. Others didnâ€™t want to
          be connected with my dad. So, they cut him off. My dad paid for my
          education up until I came out, and then he just couldnâ€™t. As I saw my
          dream of education crumble, I went to Student Office, Business Office,
          Financial Aid Office, ISS, faculty members, my tears were met with
          their inability to do anything, robotic replies, and strict policies
          to ensure fairness? â€” and just like that, in days, my aspiration to
          get a college degree was choked out. I withdrew from the college,
          after having given my last bit of energy in convincing that I did not
          deserve to have my education stopped like that just because I came out
          as gay. Being gay is not a choice, being proud of it is!

          You see in some way, I was preparing for this, slowly and steadily.
          When I was bullied a lot in high school, my dad told me "education and
          passion is your one-way ticket to a better life." I took his words to
          heart and seized every opportunity to learn. When I exhausted
          resources in high school, I discovered the art of computer programming
          and made tons of self-guided projects. My passion for scientific
          communication and hobbyist development won me{" "}
          <a href="http://www.parthraghav.com/">awards</a> at Intel
          International Science and Engineering Fair, Google Science Fair,
          American Association of Computing Machinery, Indian National Science
          Fair, et cetera. I learned a lot from a computer and an internet
          connection. And yet, all of that amounted to nothing when I picked
          each and everyoneâ€™s call as they came in shouting. My achievements and
          hard work and struggle didnâ€™t matter when I went to offices in the
          Elliot, asking for financial aid. It didnâ€™t matter when I wanted to
          register at a local university in my hometown a week ago because I
          didnâ€™t have a transcript. I asked the business office for a transcript
          but because they refused to release my transcript or any form of proof
          of successfully completing first year since I have uncleared dues of
          last semester. This means not only I cannot go to Reed anymore, but
          any university anywhere in the world, even my hometown. Things I did
          for the last 6 years of my life to get an education so that I can live
          as a free gay man didnâ€™t matter. None of it mattered, and now I am
          back to being the afraid fifteen-year-old who is clueless about how he
          can be free.

          I wrote this letter to the president, to an equally disappointing end.
          I am making this website to share with everybody my story. Education
          is important to me to escape the life of struggle my mom and dad have
          seen. I request you to help me release my transcripts by paying the
          remaining $24,802.62 (dues for the last semester). I promise to repay
          all those who help me as soon as I can. I need transcripts to complete
          a degree elsewhere and I donâ€™t have the money right now to pay up my
          dues.

          Poetry continues to be my last form of expression. Here's an excerpt
          from a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/B-zUOW6FAhD/">poem</a> I
          wrote for the Poetry Night at Reed (cancelled due to COVID).
